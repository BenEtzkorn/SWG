						BGR The Burger Joint is a gourmet burger restaurant that started in Veteran's Park - Bethesda, MD in 2008. It was
						a humble beginning in a small space off of Woodmont Avenue but we made it our own. We didn't have all the
						answers, we just knew we would make food that didn't have any compromises. Food that was thought out, fresh, and deserving of our
						customers.  At BGR, our kitchens are open for transparency into the quality food we use everyday and for customers to connect with the
						process. Our burgers are crafted with the highest quality beef and grilled to temperature over an open flame - not fried on a
						piece of stainless steel. Our bread is made for us by local bakers and delivered fresh daily. The tomatoes are the finest
						available and hand sliced - the way a tomato should be. It's not fast food, its food made right.
